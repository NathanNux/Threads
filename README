We are using (route) to initiate route groups
that way we are create groups for the app, the name of the () will not show, so only the normal folders will be shown
that can be used in a website, when you have a blog about marketing, financing, ... it can be used for keeping the url name short while having organisation within the project

this makes the app cleaner and more organized not just only for the engine
